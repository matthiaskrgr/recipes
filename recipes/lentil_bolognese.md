# Lentil Carrot Bolognese

Prep time: 10-15 minutes (guessed)  
Cooking time: 15 minutes  

Vegan  

### Ingredients:
for ~2 servings  

100 g red lentils  
1 onion or shallot  
2 carrots  
  
1-4 Tablespoons of tomato paste  
0.5 L broth  
oil  
salt  
pepper  
oregano  
sugar  

(I like to scale this one up to 500g of red lentils and 500g of carrots)


#### Prep
1) unshell and grate the carrots, cut the onions or shallots and sweat them in a pot with a bit of oil
2) in another pot, let the broth come to a boil 
3) wash the lentils
4) mix lentils and broth with the carrots
5) cook for around 15 minutes
6) add salt, pepper, sugar, oregano and tomato paste to taste

#### Notes
You can also add some coconut milk (and a little less broth) to make everything more creamy.  
Goes well with Pasta or just as is.
